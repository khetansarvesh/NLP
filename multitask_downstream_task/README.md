# Multi Task Learning


Idea can be understood from following slides

- fine tuning base LLMs on multiple tasks to get Instruction Fine Tuned LLMs
- The idea of fine tuning on many tasks was the assumption that by fine tuning on multiple tasks we can generalize and then hence can perform unseen tasks at the inference time
