# *Word Level Classification Problems*
There can be numerous word level classification tasks, some of those are

## *1. POS Tagging Task*
Please refer to following link which contains notes explaining how to handle this problem and a notebook which implements a single hidden layer LSTM RNN architechture joined trained with a no hidden layer FFNN to solve the POS Tagging task.It also contains some pretrained models for POS Tagging tasks using Spacy and NLTK library

## *2. NER Task*
Please refer to following link which contains notes explaining how to handle this problem, this is exactly similar to the POS Tagging Task except the fact that POS Tagging is a 36 class classification problem which NER is just 7 class classification problem, and rest everything is exactly same.
