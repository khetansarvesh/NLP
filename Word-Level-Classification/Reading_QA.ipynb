The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper.

From July 23 to September 1988, a group of Azerbaijani intellectuals began working for a new organization called the Popular Front of Azerbaijan, loosely based on the Estonian Popular Front. On September 17, when gun battles broke out between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis near Stepanakert, two soldiers were killed and more than two dozen injured. This led to almost tit-for-tat ethnic polarization in Nagorno-Karabakh's two main towns: The Azerbaijani minority was expelled from Stepanakert, and the Armenian minority was expelled from Shusha. On November 17, 1988, in response to the exodus of tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis from Armenia, a series of mass demonstrations began in Baku's Lenin Square, lasting 18 days and attracting half a million demonstrators.

The code above only keeps answers that are inside the context, we need to also grab the score for the impossible answer (which has start and end indices corresponding to the index of the CLS token). When one example gives several features, we have to predict the impossible answer when all the features give a high score to the impossible answer (since one feature could predict the impossible answer just because the answer isn't in the part of the context it has access too), which is why the score of the impossible answer for one example is the *minimum* of the scores for the impossible answer in each feature generated by the example.\n","\n","We then predict the impossible answer when that score is greater than the score of the best non-impossible answer.
