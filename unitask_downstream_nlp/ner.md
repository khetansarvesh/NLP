# NER Tagging
Once you understand the BIO Convention of annotating text then you will conclude that NER is exactly the same as the POS tagging task just that instead of having 36 class classification it is a 7 class classification problem. These 7 classes are : 
- O
- B-Loc
- B-Person
- B-Org
- I-Loc
- I-Person
- I-Loc
