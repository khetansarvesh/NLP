# ********** Non Generative Tasks **********

### 1. Text-2-Text Retrival

### 2. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Task
There are several NLP task of which one is NLU task.This task includes 
- Sentence level classification problems
- Token/word level classification problems

# ********** Generative Tasks / Natural Language Generation (NLG) / Text-2-Text / Sequence-2-Sequence (Seq2Seq or S2S) Tasks **********
This is a family of tasks in which we generate new sentences using input sentences. These include tasks like
  1. Machine Translation (MT)
  2. [Text Summarization](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/NLP/tree/main/unitask_downstream_nlp/text_summarization)
  3. [Paraphrasing](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/NLP/blob/main/unitask_downstream_nlp/imgs/paraphrase.png)
  4. [Machine Transliteration](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/NLP/blob/main/unitask_downstream_nlp/imgs/trans.png)
  5. DIalogue Systems (Chatbots) : Earlier these were rule based Chatbots but now they are ML / DL based
  6. Text2CodeGeneration
  7. In fact all NLU tasks can be framed as a NLG task, for instance
     - Sentimental Analysis output will be ‘this is a positive sentiment’ rather than classification of positive and negative.
     - Similarly QA can be formed as a NLG task
