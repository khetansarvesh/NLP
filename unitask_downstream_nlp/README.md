- This is a family of tasks in which we generate new sentences using input sentences. These include tasks like
  1. Machine Translation (MT)
  2. [Text Summarization](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/NLP/tree/main/unitask_downstream_nlp/generative_tasks/text_summarization)
  3. Paraphrasing
  4. Machine Transliteration
  5. DIalogue Systems (Chatbots) : Earlier these were rule based Chatbots but now they are ML / DL based
