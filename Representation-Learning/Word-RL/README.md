# Word Embedding / Word Representation Learning / Word Vectors / Word Level Modelling

I.e. to convert the corpus into its numerical form we convert all the words in the corpus into its numerical form first and then combine them in some way to get the numerical form of the corpus. 

Now once we have got the numerical representation of all the words present in the corpus which is a 1*n row vector, to get the numeric representation of the corpus which will also be 1*n row vector you can either sum up all these numerical representations of words present in the corpus or you can average them out or â€¦.. Consider this as a hyperparameter.
