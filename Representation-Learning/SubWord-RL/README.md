# Subword Embedding / Subword Representation Learning / Subword Vectors / Subword Level Modelling

  - Exactly same methods as we saw in Word representation just that instead of applying those methods on words we apply those methods on subwords. Now we get subwords we use an algorithm called Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) 

- Some famous models are :
  - InstructGPT by openAI:- Based Model used was GPT3
  - [Google FLaN PALM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVITqBHqWM4&ab_channel=DataScienceGems):- Base Model used was PALM
  - Google FLaN T5:- Base Model used was T5
  - Google FLaN U PALM:- Base Model used was U PALM
  - [Google MED PALM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBVpxR3w5G8) :- Base Model used was FLAN PALM
  - [OPT-IML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQbwZxTQX4&ab_channel=DataScienceGems) by Meta
